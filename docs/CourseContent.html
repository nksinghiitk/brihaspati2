content material inside a particular course. The page contains links for browsing 
through the content material and additional links for editing and publishing the content

<p><font color="#000000">The instructor in a particular course has the
option of editing the content material inside. He should choose the topic
which he wants</font>
<br><font color="#000000">to edit. He can update topic description and
delete attached files if he wants to do so.</font><font color="#000000"></font>

<p><font color="#000000">The content material which is uploaded to the
server by default goes to the unpublished area. The instructor has the
option to publish the content or make it accessible, visible as he may
wish to do. When the instructor makes a file accessible it is accessible
by all the users in the course but not visible by default i.e. the user
can access the resourse by specifying the URL but by default it is not
listed.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">The files are only viewable by the users after
they have been published by the instructor.</font>
