known issues v 1.2
------------------

Browsers - Mac OS X
-------------------

General
	- multiple instances of browser open sometimes causes "no context" message. (to fix - close all other instances of browser)
	

Other Issues
-------------
* Cross domain scripting - no support at this time.

* No Activity tree (roll up mechanism). In simple terms, the prerequisite engine currently ignores any items not referencing
a resource.

example...

item B1 - references nothing
	|- C1 - page1.htm
	|- C2 - page2.htm
item B2 - page3.htm	- prerequisite B1

If item B2 has a prerequisite of B1, then in the current release, it is ignored by the reload prerequisite manager.
At this time, the prerequisite manager only works on items that actually reference a resource and so does not say,
as in the example above "B1 is complete if C1 and C2 are complete".  
The package will still function, only the prerequisite in B2 is ignored. This will be addressed in a future release.
