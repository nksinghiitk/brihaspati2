MacOS X known issues for v1.2
-----------------------------

Problem
-------
On MacOS X, multiple instances of a web browser being open sometimes causes "no context..." error message or "cannot access url... " error message. Additionally, even though it seems all browser instances are closed,  MacOS X appears to keep part of the browser still running. Again this can cause the above problems.

Remedy
------

(1) Close ALL instances of your browser (If your browser shortcut is in the Dock, then right click it and choose "quit".  The little black arrow should disappear)
(2) Stop the server in the Scorm Manager window by clicking the tomcat icon. 

Now try to play a package and it should load correctly.

Problem
-------

Tree menu widget appears upside down when viewed in Safari 1.0 browser.

Remedy
------

None at this time, but will be fixed for future releases.  
The tree widget works fine when using Mac versions of Netscape 7.* or IE 5.*
(The inconsistances appear to be due to slightly different javascript implementations between safari and other browsers)
